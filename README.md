# wtf-iris-hscript

just an hscript iris fork with HEAVILY EXPERIMENTAL scripted class support

be aware that it may not work, and pull requests are HEAVILY encouraged

only goal so far is to actually add scripted class support. that includes package setting, importing, extending native classes or no class at all, etc.

seriously i need help if any haxe coder experienced with hscript is willing to help please do so
